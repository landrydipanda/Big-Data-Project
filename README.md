# Big-Data-Project

This project is part of the "Big Data" module provided in the fifth of our engineering training.

The goal of the project is to build a document classifier using the k-means++ clustering algorithm starting from a lake of document labeling data.

## Big Data / machine learning
    * Preprocessing / cleaning of the corpora
    * Feature engineering
    * Feature selection
    * Vectorization
    * Clustering using K-means++ in SPARK
    * Cluster evaluation metric: purity metric, silhouette score
    * Optimization of metrics results
## Data Vizuation
    * Metadata's association for each document
    * Preparation of CSV exports for Data Viz on tensorflow projector: https://projector.tensorflow.org/
    * Convergence of clusters

## Remarks: each trained cluster will represent a class of the data lake. The accuracy of the classes is evaluated using the "purity metrics"
## Results
    * Purity metric: 0.9/1
